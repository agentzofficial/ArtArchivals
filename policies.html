      <h2>agent z Art Archivals Content</h2>
    </p>
    <p>All images published onto the website by agent z, as well as all images made by agent z not posted on the website and are instead on agent z official social platforms may be freely used for anything you like. Credit is optional but appreciated. However, use of these images must follow these guidelines:</p>
    <ul class="dot-list">
      <li>Do not use or repost <em>agent z</em> content with the intention of plagarism or impersonation.</li>
      <li>Do not falsely claim that you are directly affiliated with the content, such as (but not limited to) claiming the content was made in a collaboration with agent z if it was not.</li>
      <li>Do not alter content, including adding captions, to portray a potentially controversial or serious topic without <strong>explicility</strong> stating that it is edited and not officially endorsed by agent z.</li>
      <li>Do not directly sell content in any form independently, such as using <em>agent z</em> content as stickers or other physical/digital media. Free distribution is allowed.</li>

    <p>
      <h2>agent z Video Content</h2>
    </p>
    <p>The guidelines for the agent z Art Archivals Content above all also apply to the use of <em>agent z</em> video content. In addition, please ensure you:</p>
    <ul class="dot-list">
      <li>Expand the video using your own creative input, such as with meaningful commentary, live reactions, or significant enough editing that differs the viewing experience entirely. This particularly applies if a significant portion of the video is being used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <h2>agent z Characters</h2>
    </p>
    <p>Original characters introduced by agent z, being Agent Z and Agent X, may be used or represented in your own content or fan artowork, which is encouraged. However, you are <strong>NOT</strong> to:</p>

      <li>Maliciously misrepresent the characters such as (not limited to) with their personality or appearance.</li>
      <li>Use the characters in any political or other sensitive context.</li>
      <li>Directly profit from the character by selling content of them without direct permission from agent z. Monetisation from platforms such as from the YouTuber Creator Prorgam or general character commissions not specifically of the original characcters are exceptions.</li>
      <li>Falsely claim you are affiliated with agent z if you are not.</li>
    </ul>
