## Sneak Peak Recap

Very little about the episode itself is known so far, with few screenshots of the episode being released by *agent z* intentionally to avoid bias for showing any particular fan character in sneak peaks. It has been stated that the episode will not lean heavily into a Christmas theme anymore due to delays, but it will still maintain "christmassy aspects". Several scenes have also supposedly been refilmed due to them looking rushed when initially trying to release the video sooner. The episode has been estimated to be around 15 minutes.
