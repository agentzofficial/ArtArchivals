Featuring a total of 54 Splatshorts released in 2024, now viewable in a completely random order in a 16:9 video format for 9 minutes of constantly changing new video clips and constant surprises!

Audio credit has also been added for Splatshorts released earlier in 2024 that did not feature audio credits in the video itself, as well as a fix for Splatshorts with incorrect credits.
