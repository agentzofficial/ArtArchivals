Scripts are necessary to ensure long animations maintain a coherent plot and aren't just 10 minutes of complete nonsense. Instead, it's SCRIPTED nonsense!

## How do you script?

There's no right or wrong way to script. Find a method to write down your stories in a way that you find enjoyable and easy to follow when you begin the animating process. Whether it be writing or typing, full paragraphs or just dot points, or even drawing how you want the scenes to look! Whatever works for you!

For Splatoon Animations, a bit of a more... different method is used. *agent z* uses a To-Do List app and instead of detailing how scenes will go or dialogue, they will type quick, shorter "scenarios" that leave room for interpretation, which allows for animating to feel less restricted as things can be made up as they go.

There is a major flaw with *agent z*'s method of scripting! Due to the script being less specific, it is much more difficult to foresee how long an episode will be.

For instance, the episodes *Battle of Inkopolis Square* and *Stories of the Agents* had very open scripts, only having 14 to-do list points between them! The episodes are almost **an hour long** combined!!

Not only that, this scripting method makes it very common to have animated scenes that "looked better in my head", requiring either a change in the script or getting stuck trying to reanimate the scene to look better.

Due to these issues, each to-do list point has been made shorter and slightly more specific so episodes can be better mapped. For instance, *Power Outage* has 71 points, which made for an 11 minute episode.

And hey, that video wasn't delayed! That's progress.

Here are some of the to-do list points used in *Power Outage*. Notice how I can also move things around in the script, causing things to go a bit out of order, but that's okay.
