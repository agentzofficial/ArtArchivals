Agent Z learns of Valentine's Day, a day where you're meant to give a gift to the person you like most! According to her, at least. She wants to give a gift to Agent X immediately for this day, but she doesn't quite know what she would want. You don't want to risk gifting her something she already owns, underwhelming gifts, gifts she may not even be interested in, what could Agent Z possibly gift to Agent X?

She better find out what to gift her fast before the day ends! Otherwise, she risks disappointing Agent X by not having a gift ready. Time doesn't seem to be on her side though, and eventually, she's going to have to face Agent X before the day ends!
