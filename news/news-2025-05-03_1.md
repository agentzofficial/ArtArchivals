Not to fear! With the Great Zapfish collapsed in Splatsville, Deep Cut feels responsible for trying to wake them all up! But there's no standard protocol to follow anywhere for, "How to wake up collapsed Great Zapfishes?". So, Deep Cut is left to do anything they can to wake them up.

With the technology being out for so long, card games can only keep someone busy for so long, and especially a Neo Agent 3. The cast must figure out how they can keep Neo Agent 3 busy... by any means.
