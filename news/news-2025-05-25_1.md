Something special may await the fans at 10,000 subscribers.

A render has been posted first to Bluesky hinting at a potential 10,000 subscriber special for the agent z YouTube channel. It features Agent Z drawing something on a piece of paper with a cube featuring the Discord logo sitting to the right of her, suggesting the possibility of a Discord server of sorts in the works.

*agent z* generally makes special renders for every thousand subscriber milestone. With the YouTube channel soon to cross into the ten-thousands, it seems like *agent z* wants to do something more special than just a render this time around.
