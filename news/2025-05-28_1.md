After a brief hiatus, Splatshorts have made a return with a short dedicated to GameChat, a new feature on the Nintendo Switch 2, being uploaded suddenly.

Splatshorts faced a sudden hiatus after *How to WIN at Chess* was released on the 31st of January, 2025. It was likely due to *agent z* wanting to focus their attention on *The Perfect Present*, a Splatoon Animation that had been in production since December 2024 and was intended on being released as early as the 28th of December, before it faced delays. Despite the video finally being released on the 30th of March 2025, Splatshorts were still not uploaded and the next episode, *Power Outage*, was released without any Splatshorts inbetween.

Splatshorts will maintain its former upload schedule with new shorts being uploaded every Tuesday at 4pm UTC. The purpose of these weekly animations are so there's always some content to watch from *agent z* while Splatoon Animations are being worked on.
