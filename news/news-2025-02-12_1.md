An update on the next video has been posted in the YouTube Community tab. There, *agent z* goes into detail on the state of the episode.

*agent z* explains their reasoning for continued delays, being linked to audio editing and the need to refilm scenes that appear rushed. It is also confirmed that the episode will no longer be a direct Christmas special, being made more neutral to make it lean less into a Christmas theme due to the episode's delays.

No screenshots of the episode itself have been shared to prevent potential bias in showing particular fan characters over others. No release date has been given yet due to the video not being close enough to completion to give it a definitive release date.
