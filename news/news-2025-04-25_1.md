The first image features Neo Agent 3 and Agent 8 playing a video game off screen using Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers. While it's common to see the two here in Splatshorts, it has yet to actually be seen in a Splatoon Animation. Neo Agent 3 seems focused on the game, while Agent 8 looks relatively relaxed, just having fun!

The second image features 3 Great Zapfish on the ground in Splatsville in visible shock. What could it mean?

The third image features Agent X peaking around a door with a more devious expression, alongside orange lighting. She wouldn't be planning something bad again, right?

The fourth and final image in the community post features Agent Z and Agent 3 looking surprised at something towards the camera off screen. This confirms that the entire main cast will appear in the episode in some way. But wait, what's that thing behind Agent Z? I don't remember that being in the apartment.

All questions will be answered when this episode is uploaded on May 3rd! Hope to see you there!
