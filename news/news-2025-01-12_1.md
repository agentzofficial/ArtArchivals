After previously announcing a delay in the next episode due to flying overseas, *agent z* has recently announced that
they have returned, implying their continuation of producing animations.

On the 28th December, 2024, it was announced that *agent z* had to fly overseas with family for 2 weeks, where they would be unable to work on the video. After a vote
on whether the episode should be rushed to be released in 2024 or be postponed to January 2025, it was unanimously decided that the video should be postponed.

Nothing was posted publicly by *agent z* while they were overseas on any of their social platforms aside from one Splatshort, *In the Blink of an Eye…*, which was likely scheduled prior.
